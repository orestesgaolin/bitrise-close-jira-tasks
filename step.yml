# If this step should be available only for certain project types
# just uncomment this `project_type_tags` section and include all the
# project types supported by the step. If the step can be used for all
# project types then you can just remove this section.
# If no `project_type_tags` specified (or specified as an empty array)
# that means the step can be used for any project type.
